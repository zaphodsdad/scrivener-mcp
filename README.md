# Scrivener MCP

An MCP server that connects AI assistants to your Scrivener writing projects.

**Status:** Early development

## What is this?

[Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview) is a beloved writing app for novelists, screenwriters, and long-form writers. This MCP server lets AI assistants (like Claude) read and understand your Scrivener projects.

Point Claude at your novel and ask:
- "Find inconsistencies in my character descriptions"
- "What plot threads are unresolved?"
- "Help me write the next scene"
- "Where do I mention the lighthouse?"

## Installation
